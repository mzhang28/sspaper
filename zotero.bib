With respect to objective (1), we provide new direct definitions of the cohomology group operations and of the cup product, which, just as in (Brunerie et al., 2022), enable significant simplifications of many earlier proofs in synthetic cohomology theory. In particular, the new definition of the cup product allows us to give the first complete formalisation of the axioms needed to turn the cohomology groups into a graded commutative ring. We also establish that this cohomology theory satisfies the {HoTT} formulation of the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for cohomology and study the classical Mayer-Vietoris and Gysin sequences. With respect to objective (2), we characterise the cohomology groups and rings of various spaces, including the spheres, torus, Klein bottle, real/complex projective planes, and infinite real projective space. All results have been formalised in Cubical Agda and we obtain multiple new numbers, similar to the famous `Brunerie number', which can be used as benchmarks for computational implementations of {HoTT}. Some of these numbers are infeasible to compute in Cubical Agda and hence provide new computational challenges and open problems which are much easier to define than the original Brunerie number.},

To this end, we introduce appropriate definitions of direct sums and graded rings, which we then use to define both cohomology rings and multivariate polynomial rings. Using this, we compute the cohomology rings of some classical spaces, such as the spheres and the Klein bottle.

            Proof assistants based on dependent type theory provide expressive languages for both programming and proving within the same system. However, all of the major implementations lack powerful extensionality principles for reasoning about equality, such as function and propositional extensionality. These principles are typically added axiomatically which disrupts the constructive properties of these systems. Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types ({HITs}). This paper describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of {HITs}. These new primitives allow the direct definition of function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types, all with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types. The adoption of cubical type theory extends Agda with support for a wide range of extensionality principles, without sacrificing type checking and constructivity.},

Then the unstable E-infinite extension theorem states how adjacent filtration quotients of the colimit filtration are extended by \$E{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ objects over corresponding adjacent filtration quotients of the kernel filtration. The stable E-infinity extension theorem is based on the fact that the derivation process of the exact couple admits a transfinite recursion which is beyond the scope of the traditional spectral sequence perspective. The transfinite recursion always stabilizes at some ordinal. The resulting stable \$E\$-objects are (a) always subobjects of \$E{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ and (b) extend adjacent filtration quotients of the colimit filtration over corresponding adjacent filtration quotients of the kernel filtration \{{\textbackslash}em without\} the need for lim-1 corrective terms. The E-infinity extension theorems enable conclusions about the filtered limit/colimit abutments even in cases where the spectral sequence is far from converging in any traditional sense. We develop such results in the context of 'comparing' the spectral sequences via the morphism that is induced by a morphism of underlying exact couples. We also contribute to 'reverse comparison' in a spectral sequence; that is using information about the universal abutment(s) of the underlying exact couple to extract information about one or more pages of the spectral sequence. These results overlap with Zeeman's comparison theorems in a generalizing fashion.},

Spectral sequences form a powerful tool which can be used to compute homotopy, homology and cohomology groups of a wide variety of spaces. We have constructed two important spectral sequences in homotopy type theory, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch and Serre spectral sequences for cohomology. These spectral sequences have analogues for homology, but they have not been constructed in {HoTT} yet. However, many parts of our construction could be reused to construct the corresponding spectral sequences for homology.

In this talk I will introduce spectral sequences and review the spectral sequences we have constructed and some of their applications. Furthermore, I will describe what parts are still missing to construct the Atiyah-Hirzebruch and Serre spectral sequences for homology.

The construction of the spectral sequences for cohomology is joint work with Jeremy Avigad, Steve Awodey, Ulrik Buchholtz, Egbert Rijke and Mike Shulman.},

	abstract = {In a type-theoretic fibration category in the sense of Shulman (representing a dependent type theory with at least 1, Sigma, Pi, and identity types), we define the type of constant functions from A to B. This involves an infinite tower of coherence conditions, and we therefore need the category to have Reedy limits of diagrams over omega. Our main result is that, if the category further has propositional truncations and satisfies function extensionality, the type of constant function is equivalent to the type {\textbar}{\textbar}A{\textbar}{\textbar} -{\textgreater} B. If B is an n-type for a given finite n, the tower of coherence conditions becomes finite and the requirement of nontrivial Reedy limits vanishes. The whole construction can then be carried out in Homotopy Type Theory and generalises the universal property of the truncation. This provides a way to define functions {\textbar}{\textbar}A{\textbar}{\textbar} -{\textgreater} B if B is not known to be propositional, and it streamlines the common approach of finding a proposition Q with A -{\textgreater} Q and Q -{\textgreater} B.},

              K*(X)
              ). Obviously, it would be useful to know the differentials in this spectral sequence, and it is the purpose of this paper to identify them in terms of cohomology operations defined by certain
              k
              -invariants. We shall make use of E. H. Brown's recent theorem (5) on the representability of extraordinary cohomology theories, to construct a second spectral sequence, in which the differentials are readily identifiable, which we shall prove is isomorphic to the usual one.},
